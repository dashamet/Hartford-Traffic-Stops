# Traffic Stops in Hartford, Connecticut

* `hartford.Rmd` my analysis of traffic stop data in Hartford, Connecticut. It produces the HTML file `hartford.html`. 
  * In part 1, I conduct a preliminary exploratory analysis of the data. 
  * In part 2, I create a table which breaks down arrest rates by race and gender. 
  * In part 3, I graph the distribution of arrests by time of day. 
  * In part 4, I create a map showing arrest locations and arrestees' gender for each racial group. 

* I used data from the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/).
