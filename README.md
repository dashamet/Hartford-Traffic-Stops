# Traffic Stops in Hartford, Connecticut

This repo contains my analysis of traffic stop data in Hartford, Connecticut. In part 1, I answer basic questions about the data. In part 2, I create a table comparing arrest rates among various races and genders. In part 3, I create a graph which shows the distribution of arrests by time of day. In part 4, I create distinct maps for 4 racial groups that show where arrests took place and indicate the arrestee's gender. 

The data I used is from the Stanford Open Policing Project: https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/
